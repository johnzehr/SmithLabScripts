# Smith Lab R&S Scripts
Issuing programming commands to lab test equipment from a computer requires the use of SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) commands. 
Applying these commands from a terminal without substantial knowledge of SCPI command structure and formatting would likely require the frequent referencing of a SCPI
Command Tree, which can make this process less efficient. Thus, to expedite the speed at which radar experiments can be conducted, this repository was 
created to contain an ever-growing list of commands defined under simple Python functions. This README will explain the uses of the various functions.
